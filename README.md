A terminal UI for Kubernetes, inspired by [Lens IDE](https://k8slens.dev/), [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), and [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s). Built with Go and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

## Features

- **26 built-in resource types + CRD support** -- dynamic discovery of Custom Resources at startup, across Cluster / Workloads / Network / Config / Storage / RBAC / Autoscaling categories
- **Real-time Watch updates** -- resources refresh automatically via Kubernetes Watch API
- **Vim-style navigation** -- `j`/`k`, `u`/`d` page scroll, `gg`/`G`, `/` search
- **3-panel lazygit-style layout** -- numbered sidebar, list, and detail panels with scroll indicator
- **Drill-down navigation** -- Deployment / DaemonSet / StatefulSet / Job → Pods → Containers; CronJob → Jobs; HPA → target workload; PVC → mounting Pods; PDB → protected Pods
- **Relatives tab — Lens-style graph navigation** -- every detail panel (except Namespaces) lists the resource's navigable references (owners, selected pods, scaleTargetRef, mounted-by pods, ...). `Enter`/`l` drills into the cursor's ref — the panel re-renders showing *that* resource's Relatives, building a chain (Deployment → Pod → ConfigMap → consumer Pods, ...). `h`/`Esc` pops one level. `b` opens a breadcrumb popup so you can jump back to any ancestor in one step. `Space` jumps panels 1+2 to the cursor's ref (confirms first) — so a chain you walked into can become the new primary view. Tab label shows `Relatives N` at depth>1. `Y` opens the YAML of whichever entry the cursor is on. Cycle detection blocks revisiting an ancestor; fetch failures toast and stay put. 25 of 26 resource kinds covered — ConfigMaps / Secrets / ServiceAccounts surface *reverse* refs (which Pods use me, which RoleBindings name this SA as a subject, ...)
- **YAML popup (`Y`)** -- raw `kubectl get -o yaml` of the selected resource in a full-screen overlay with `j/k/u/d/gg/G` scroll, `/` search (`n`/`N` step through matches with full-row highlight), `y` to copy the full YAML to your clipboard, and `e` to dispatch `kubectl edit` directly from the popup. YAML lives in the popup, not the detail panel, so vertical layout no longer wraps long YAML lines awkwardly
- **Pod log streaming with auto-follow** -- multi-container support with `<container>|<log>` format; the Logs tab sticks to the tail by default (a `▼` marker in `[3] Logs ▼` shows follow is active). Scroll up (`k`/`↑`/`u`/`gg`) to pause and read history; press `G` to catch up and resume following
- **Aggregate logs for Deployments** -- selecting a Deployment streams logs from **every pod in the current ReplicaSet** into a single Logs tab (also the default tab for Deployment detail). Lines are prefixed `<pod-hash>│<container>│<text>` with each segment in its own stable color, so during a rollout you can spot at a glance which pod is throwing errors without drill-down. Pods churning during rollout: the stream snapshots at row-select; re-select the Deployment row to refresh. Falls back to Deployment selector when current-ReplicaSet lookup fails (e.g. missing RBAC on ReplicaSet)
- **Edit & shell exec via embedded PTY** -- `e` runs `kubectl edit` and `s` runs `kubectl exec -it -- /bin/sh`, both inside an in-app virtual terminal so the editor and shell session never touch the host terminal scrollback. Editor honors `$KUBE_EDITOR` / `$EDITOR` (or `config.yaml editor`)
- **KM8erm internal terminal** -- `Alt+t` toggles an embedded shell (login shell with full env / cwd) inside km8 — like `ssh localhost` in a popup. Run `kubectl apply -f`, `helm`, anything you'd normally drop out of km8 to do. The shell is **persistent**: pressing `Alt+t` while the popup is visible hides it without killing the shell; pressing it again reattaches (cwd, history, env, background jobs all preserved). A green `attached` / amber `km8erm` chip in the status bar (right after `ns:`) shows which state you're in
- **PTY scrollback** -- 10k-line history for all PTY popups (KM8erm, shell exec, edit). `PgUp` / `PgDn` page, `Home` / `End` jump to top / live. Disabled in alt-screen apps (vim, less, htop) so they keep their own paging
- **Colored Pod status** -- `Running` green, `Pending` yellow, `CrashLoopBackOff` / `ImagePullBackOff` / `OOMKilled` red, `Terminating` gray. STATUS column shows the kubectl-equivalent reason, not raw `Pod.Status.Phase`
- **Per-container colored log labels** -- multi-container pods are visually distinguishable line-by-line; stable color per container name
- **Resource deletion** -- `D` with confirmation dialog
- **Search/filter** -- `/` to search in all three panels and in the namespace/context picker popups. Sidebar search also matches category names (e.g. "cluster" expands the Cluster category)
- **Clipboard copy (`y`)** -- copies the focused panel's content via OSC 52 (works through tmux/SSH, no `xclip`/`pbcopy` required). Inside the App Log popup (`!`), `y` copies the full log; inside the YAML popup, `y` copies the full YAML
- **Toast notifications with levels** -- info-level (1s sky-blue) for confirmations like "Copied!"; warning-level (2s peach with `󰀦`) for blocked actions like Relatives cycle detection or drill failures
- **Namespace and context switching** -- `n`/`N` for namespace, `c`/`C` for context (uppercase aliases for users who prefer them; both open the same picker)
- **Panel-aware selection styling** -- the focused panel's cursor row gets a bright reverse-video highlight; the *unfocused* panel's selected row keeps a softer bg + bold so you can always see which resource each panel "remembers" while you work in another. Pod STATUS uses a darker palette variant when it lands on a light-bg highlighted row so the green/yellow/red stays readable
- **Detail tabs** -- `Relatives` / `Logs` (Pods + Deployments) / `Events`. Relatives is always first when present, so `Space` jumps land on the same tab you came from
- **Long values wrap, never truncate** -- applies to YAML, Events, and Logs; wrap points reflow on panel resize
- **Panel expand** -- `=`/`-` to toggle full-screen Table or Detail panel
- **Theme system** -- drop a `theme.yaml` into config directory to override colors
- **Help & App Log overlays** -- `?` / `!` popup on top of main UI
- **Error notifications** -- status bar badge + status line message
- **Crash logging** -- panics written to the km8 log directory
- **Audit logging** -- every `kubectl edit` and `kubectl delete` recorded to `audit-*.log`

## Key Bindings

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | Move cursor up / down |
| `u` / `d` | Page up / down |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to top / bottom |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Switch panel |
| `Tab` | Cycle panels |

### Sidebar (Panel 1)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | Move cursor (auto-selects the resource and restarts the watcher) |
| `l` / `Enter` | Move focus to Panel 2 (resource already selected by `j`/`k`, no reload) |
| `/` | Search / filter resource names + category names |

### Table (Panel 2)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `/` | Search / filter |
| `Enter` | Drill into children (Pods → Containers, HPA → workload, ...) **or** move focus to Panel 3 when the resource has nothing to drill into |
| `e` | Edit resource via `kubectl edit` (asks for confirmation) |
| `D` | Delete resource (asks for confirmation) |
| `s` | Shell into container via `kubectl exec -it` (asks for confirmation) |

### Detail (Panel 3)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `h` / `l` | Switch tab (only from Panel 2 — on Panel 3 these belong to the Relatives chain) |
| `=` / `-` | Expand / restore panel |
| `G` | Jump to bottom (on Logs: also resumes follow-tail) |
| `k` / `↑` / `u` / `gg` | Scroll up (on Logs: pauses follow-tail) |

### Relatives tab (drill chain)

`Enter` and `l` push a frame onto the chain; `h` / `Esc` pop. `Space` jumps the table to whatever ref the cursor is on (confirms first). The tab label shows depth as `Relatives N` once you've drilled, and the panel border carries a `[b]readcrumbs` hint at the top-right.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | Move cursor between drillable refs |
| `Enter` / `l` | Drill into the cursor's ref (push frame) |
| `h` / `Esc` | Back one level (pop frame). No-op at root |
| `b` | Open the breadcrumb popup — `j`/`k` to pick a level, `Enter` to jump back, `Space` to switch panels to that level, `Esc`/`q`/`b` to close |
| `Space` | Switch panels 1+2 to the cursor's ref (asks for confirmation). Drill chain resets afterwards |
| `Y` | Open the YAML popup of the cursor's ref |

### Global

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `n` / `N` | Switch namespace (`/` to filter inside the popup) |
| `c` / `C` | Switch context (`/` to filter inside the popup) |
| `Alt+t` | Toggle KM8erm (spawn / show / hide; shell stays alive across hide) |
| `y` | Copy focused panel content to clipboard (OSC 52) |
| `Y` | Open YAML popup (`j/k/u/d/gg/G` scroll, `/` search, `y` copy, `e` edit, `Esc` close) |
| `!` | App log |
| `?` | Toggle help |
| `q` | Quit km8 (asks for confirmation) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit km8 immediately (no confirm) |
| `Esc` | Close current modal / overlay |

### PTY popups (KM8erm, edit, shell exec)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll history by one page |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to top of history / back to live |
| Any other key | Snap back to live, key forwards to subprocess |

Scrollback is disabled when a full-screen app (vim, less, htop) takes over the PTY via alt-screen; those keys forward to the app instead so it keeps its own paging.

## Editing Resources

Pressing `e` on a resource runs **`kubectl edit <kind>/<name> -n <ns> --context <ctx>`** inside an embedded PTY popup. Behavior is identical to running the same command in a terminal: strategic merge patch, `resourceVersion` conflict detection, no `last-applied-configuration` annotation side-effect.

The editor is resolved by kubectl itself in this priority order:

1. `$KUBE_EDITOR` (km8 sets this if `editor` is configured in `config.yaml`)
2. `$EDITOR`
3. `vi` (Linux/macOS) or `notepad` (Windows)

When the editor exits, the popup closes and the table refreshes via the resource watch — no manual reload needed.

### Why an embedded PTY?

Earlier versions of km8 ran the editor through `tea.ExecProcess` and applied the result with `kubectl apply -f`. That approach leaked kubectl's confirmation messages into the host terminal's scrollback after quitting km8, and the apply-vs-edit semantic mismatch surprised users coming from `kubectl edit`. The PTY popup keeps everything inside km8 and uses `kubectl edit` directly so behavior is exactly what `kubectl edit` users expect.

### Note for nvim users

If your nvim setup has noticeable shutdown lag inside the popup (LSP attach/detach, plugin teardown), set `editor: "nvim --noplugin"` in `config.yaml` to skip plugin loading for the kubectl-edit session only. Your everyday `nvim` is unaffected.

## Context Isolation

km8 maintains its own **session-local** context. Switching context with `c` inside km8 **does not** modify `~/.kube/config` or the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable in any other terminal.

All `kubectl` subprocesses spawned by km8 (edit, delete, shell exec) receive an explicit `--context <name>` flag, so they always target the cluster km8 is showing — regardless of what `kubectl`'s default context is set to.

This means you can safely run km8 in one terminal while using `kubectl` in another without either session interfering with the other's context.

## Configuration

Config files are in the OS-appropriate config directory. Set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to override on any platform:

| OS | Default Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/km8/` or `~/.config/km8/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/km8/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/km8/` |

Logs (crash and audit) are written to the `logs/` subdirectory of the config directory.

### config.yaml

```yaml
default_context: ""      # kubeconfig context (default: current-context)
default_namespace: ""    # namespace filter (default: all namespaces)
editor: ""               # exposed to kubectl as $KUBE_EDITOR
                         # (default: kubectl falls back to $EDITOR → vi / notepad)
```

### theme.yaml

Drop a `theme.yaml` to customize colors. Only override what you need -- unspecified fields keep defaults.

```yaml
sidebar:
  background: ""                       # empty = terminal transparent
  foreground: "#cdd6f4"
