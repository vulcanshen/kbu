## [v1.0.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- Status bar and status line backgrounds removed (terminal transparent)
- Status line text color changed to blue (#89b4fa, matching panel focus color)
- Status line simplified: removed panel titles, kept panel number + hotkeys only

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **CRD support** -- dynamic discovery of Custom Resource Definitions at startup via API server, automatic registration into sidebar under "Custom Resources" category
- **Resource registry pattern** -- centralized ResourceDefinition struct replaces 6 scattered switch statements; adding a new resource type requires a single Register() call
- **Dynamic client** -- k8s.Client now includes dynamic.Interface for CRD fetch/watch/detail
- **Error notifications** -- status bar shows red error badge with unread count; status line shows latest error message; clears on viewing app log
- **Scroll position indicator** -- "X of Y" in bottom-right border of all panels (sidebar, table, detail)
- **Page scroll (u/d)** -- half-page up/down in sidebar, table, detail, and app log
- **Help overlay popup** -- `?` overlays keybinding reference on top of main UI using bubbletea-overlay library
- **App log overlay popup** -- `!` overlays app log on top of main UI with unified format (timestamp + level + message)
- **Sidebar viewport scrolling** -- cursor stays within visible viewport, auto-scrolls at edges; category headers stay visible when scrolling up
- **Debounced API requests** -- 300ms debounce on sidebar resource switching to avoid flooding the API server
- **Crash logging** -- panics captured and written to `~/.config/km8/logs/crash-TIMESTAMP.log` with stack trace
- **Version flag** -- `km8 --version` / `km8 -v`
- **Release pipeline** -- goreleaser v2 config for multi-platform builds (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64), Homebrew tap, Scoop bucket
- **GitHub Actions** -- tag-triggered release workflow with cross-platform tests
- **GPL-3.0 license**

### Changed
- **ResourceType** changed from `int` (iota) to `string` for CRD compatibility
- **Delete key** changed from `d` to `D` (shift+D) to free `d` for page-down
- **Detail tab keys** changed from `[`/`]` to `h`/`l` for consistency with vim motion
- **Search icon** changed from `/` character to nerd font filter icon (U+F0233)
- **App log order** reversed -- newest entries at the top
- **API rate limit** increased from default QPS 5/Burst 10 to QPS 50/Burst 100
- **Watcher lifecycle** -- channels are closed and recreated on each Start() to prevent stale goroutines from stealing data

### Fixed
- Crash on rapid resource switching (stale ResourceDataMsg with wrong type causing type assertion panic)
- Nil pointer crash when ResourceErrorMsg.Err is nil
- Sidebar scroll not working (height was 0 before first View render; now set in layout on WindowSizeMsg)
- Help page content outdated (missing c/!/D/s keys, stale `[`/`]` reference)
